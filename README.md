The proved version of Image-classification-with-Federal-learning-in-the-dataset-CIARF10-based-on-federal-learning

The basic version you can see in the project in my repositories name is "Image-classification-with-Federal-learning-in-the-dataset-CIARF10-based-on-federal-learning ":
[Image-classification-with-Federal-learning-in-the-dataset-CIARF10-based-on-federal-learning]([https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name](https://github.com/2471845937/Image-classification-with-Federal-learning-in-the-dataset-CIARF10-based-on-federal-learning)

The server in this version will sak the user whether use the connected clients or not, and then, if you connect a new client to the server while the server is in a training round, the server will ask you the same question before the next round start. This process enables the client to be added at any time during the training process. And when a client exits, the subsequent training will automatically use the remaining clients for task allocation and training.
